# Week 1: Design of AI-Powered Workflows
## Slide 1: Title
- **Introduction to AI-Powered Systems (AIPS)**
- Instructor: [Your Name]
- Date: February 23, 2025

## Slide 2: What Are AI-Powered Systems?
- **Definition**: Systems using AI to perform tasks or make decisions (e.g., chatbots, self-driving cars).
- **Key Feature**: Learn from data, not just follow fixed rules.
- **Examples**: Spam filters, GPT-3, autonomous agents.

## Slide 3: Types of AIPS
- **Trained on Data**: Custom-trained models (e.g., spam filters).
- **Pretrained/Generative**: Prebuilt, creative models (e.g., GPT-3, Stable Diffusion).
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines retrieval and generation (e.g., chatbots with web data).
- **Agentic**: Autonomous decision-makers (e.g., virtual assistants).

## Slide 4: AIPS vs. Traditional Software
- **Traditional**: Explicit code, deterministic.
- **AIPS**: Data-driven, probabilistic.
- **Differences**:
  - Data dependency vs. rule-based.
  - Hard to explain vs. clear logic.
  - Continuous updates vs. static code.

## Slide 5: Challenges in AIPS Design
- Data quality and quantity.
- Making decisions explainable.
- Avoiding bias and ensuring ethics.
- Security and privacy risks.
- Balancing efficiency and performance.

## Slide 6: Properties of a Good AIPS
- Accurate and reliable.
- Robust to varied inputs.
- Fair and unbiased.
- Transparent and explainable.
- Efficient and secure.

## Slide 7: Practical Tip - Customize VS Code for AIPS Work
- **Why**: Distinguish multiple AI projects visually.
- **How**:
  1. Open each project in a new VS Code window.
  2. Set a unique theme per workspace (File > Preferences > Settings > Workspace > Color Theme).
  3. (Optional) Use "Peacock" extension for window-specific colors.
- **Example**: Dark theme for training data project, light theme for RAG project.

## Slide 8: Week 1 Exercises
- **In-Class**: Build an Iris classifier in Colab (see notebook).
- **Homework**: Create a chatbot with ChatterBot.
- **Project Kickoff**: Plan an AI workflow (due Week 7).

## Slide 9: Next Steps
- Readings: "AI: A Modern Approach" (Ch. 1), Lewis et al. on RAG.
- Prepare for Week 2: Types of AIPS in depth.
