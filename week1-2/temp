# Week 1: AI-Powered Systems Exercises
# Instructor: [Your Name]
# Date: February 23, 2025

# Welcome to the Week 1 hands-on session! We'll build a simple machine learning model
# to classify Iris flowers, introducing you to an AI-powered system trained on data.

# Import libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target
feature_names = iris.feature_names
target_names = iris.target_names

# Convert to DataFrame for exploration
df = pd.DataFrame(X, columns=feature_names)
df['species'] = [target_names[i] for i in y]

# Explore the data
print("Dataset Preview:")
print(df.head())
print("\nSpecies Distribution:")
print(df['species'].value_counts())

# Visualize the data
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.scatterplot(data=df, x='sepal length (cm)', y='sepal width (cm)', hue='species', palette='deep')
plt.title('Sepal Length vs. Width by Species')
plt.show()

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train a Random Forest model (an AI-powered system!)
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"\nModel Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")

# Exercise 1: Modify the model
# Try changing n_estimators to 50 or 200. How does accuracy change?
# Your code here:

# Exercise 2: VS Code Setup
# 1. Open VS Code and create two project folders (e.g., 'Iris_Classifier' and 'Chatbot').
# 2. Open each in a separate window.
# 3. Set a different theme for each (e.g., Dark+ for Iris, Light+ for Chatbot).
# Instructions: File > Preferences > Settings > Workspace > Color Theme.

# Homework: Build a Chatbot
# Install ChatterBot (pip install chatterbot) locally in VS Code.
# Follow this guide: https://realpython.com/build-a-chatbot-python-chatterbot/
# Submit your chatbot code by next class.

# See you next week!
